## System Programs  
System programs are server and GUI programs that provide various services in Innova. There are two types of system programs:
 
1. Service programs that run as background processes on the Innova server or other computers in the Innova system.  
2. WinUI programs that run the user interfaces on IPCs, PDAs or other devices.

The base Innova configuration includes five system programs.

### Program Manager  
Progman.exe manages the execution of background programs on the Innova server and on other servers and PCs in the Innova system.
 
The system has one program manager for every server to manage the execution of programs.

### Base Services 
**Mp5services.exe** provides the four system-wide services described below. There can only be one mp5services program installed in each Innova system. 
 
* Message service - Used to route SSI packets between programs.  
* Licensing service - Provides support functions for the Innova licensing system.
