### Device
A machine or piece of equipment that is connected to Innova so that it can be configured, controlled and monitored. Innova collects data from devices and generates reports to monitor yield, throughput, quality, capacity and labor efficiency.
Â 
* A device can be a physical device, like a scale, grader, PDA, scanner, or printer.  
* It can also be software, like a Windows printer driver.

For devices, it is important to note that some devices may be part of a line.
