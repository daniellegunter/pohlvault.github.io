## Innova explained
Innova Food Processing software ranges from simple device control modules to total processing solutions adapted to the individual needs of food processors.
Innova ensures reliable data collection, providing full traceability throughout the production process. It includes real-time monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as yield, throughput, quality, capacity and labor efficiency. These valuable insights enable processors to identify opportunities for improvements, while ensuring that production conforms to quality and food safety standards.
### A powerful interconnected management system
1. **Reception of supplies**  
Supplies are received into the system, checked, weighed and labeled. All traceability information is entered and supplies assigned to stock. In the fresh products industry it is vital to control the raw material stock to reduce loss and to age products to the optimal stage.
2. **Raw material inventory**  
Raw material stock levels are known at all times. Items can be assigned to stock a location as they enter the inventory. For each item on stock, information such as quantity, age, expiry date, location and supplier is important for production planning and scheduling. When items are assigned to different production lines, accurate information is available about raw material usage, cost and origin of raw material per production line.
3. **Processing**  
Marel offers a wide range of processing equipment that is all linked to Innova for the most accurate processing control available. Innova can control individual machinery or whole processing lines such as intelligent portioning and trimming machines, grading and batching equipment, trimming and boning lines, packing and labeling lines, all kinds of weighing equipment, vision units and RFID logistic solutions. All this equipment provides real-time data for performance monitoring to optimize profitability at each stage.
4. **Packing**  
Advanced packing and labeling solutions with full inventory, palletizing and order processing capabilities. The system provides full support for in-process weighing, inventory control, packing, giveaway monitoring and finished goods outer case marking. Orders can be processed on-line, pallets built automatically and labels printed based on real-time data. End products can be traced back to the supplierâ€™s delivery.
